# Smart Parking Detection with YOLOv8

**Course:** Computer Vision

Welcome to the **Smart Parking Detection** project powered by **YOLOv8s**! This repository provides an efficient, real-time solution for identifying available parking spaces.

## üìå Project Overview

With rapid urbanization and growing vehicle numbers, finding an empty parking spot has become a daily challenge, leading to wasted time, fuel consumption, and increased traffic congestion.

Our solution leverages computer vision and deep learning to detect free parking slots in real time using a standard camera,
NO need for costly sensor installations.

## üß† YOLOv8 Architecture

YOLOv8 is the latest one-stage detector from Ultralytics, designed for real-time object detection with modular scalability (variants from nano to extra-large). We selected YOLOv8s (small) to balance accuracy and inference speed:
![yolov8 architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70da1e49-f917-467c-887d-36266f3cd813)

Backbone: Modified CSPDarknet53 structure with C2f modules, which concatenate feature maps to improve gradient flow and extract rich hierarchical features.

Neck: PANet-style path aggregation network combining multi-scale features for robust detection of objects at varying sizes.

Head: Anchor-free detection head with direct class and bounding-box predictions, removing the need for preset anchors and improving convergence.

##  üé® Data Augmentation

To ensure robustness under diverse conditions, we applied extensive augmentations via Roboflow‚Äôs pipeline on our 1,200+ image dataset:

Resizing & Normalization: Standardized to 640√ó640 pixels and applied pixel-value normalization.

Photometric Jitter: Random brightness and contrast adjustments to mimic varied lighting (day, dusk, night).

Geometric Transforms: Horizontal flips and random rotations to improve viewpoint invariance.

Noise Injection: Gaussian noise simulating sensor artifacts and low-light grain.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Over 1,200 images of parking lots under various lighting (day, dusk, night) and weather (rain, fog) conditions.
2. **Preprocessing**: Resize to 640√ó640, adjust brightness/contrast, apply rotations, flips, and synthetic noise.
3. **Training**: Transfer learning from COCO-pretrained weights; 10 epochs using SGD with learning rate 0.01 and step decay every 5 epochs.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics include mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and inference speed (FPS).
